what if you had 3 (4?5?) sliders, normalised which determined how much you spent on the following
 - economy 
 - attack (takes a few seconds to get across the board)
 - defense (smaller latency than attack)
 - scout (get more warning, info about other player)
 - tech (same as investing in ecnonomy?)

as time progresses (or economy grows) there is less latency on action
from 0 scout to max scout, 1 second for the info to catch up

differenciating races, defence/ attack easier, different latency times on skills
for 'n' multiplayer, just have to select at which opponent you are directing your attack at?
or different attack slider for each oppoenent



if you had all your focus on economy, how long would it take to double? 30sec? 100sec?
if you put all your focus on attack, how long would it take to reduce the starting economy to zero, 10seconds? 15seconds? 5 seconds to cross the map.
the starting settings for scout, lets you see 25% of board, if it takes 5sec to traverse board, then latency on defence is 1 sec to allow time to get defences up?

add a few ping buttons to ramp up scouting to 25,50,75,100% the last 25% starts giving info about the economy, not just the attacks coming down the pipe. 
your own scout radius (if not zero) will show when the opponent scouts you?

attacks against defences need to be sustained by bot sides, but do attacks against economy just keep doing damage till defended against.
in multiplayer game, is it possible to take over another player's base? possibly not good idea
