[Background]

Named after the Greek mythology nymph Echo who fell in love with Narcissus but was unable to communicate her feelings due to a curse received from Zeus' wife Hera, causing her to only be able to repeat the last work said to her.

This child was created from a beautiful woman smart phone fixation, and can only perceive the world through the background of photos she takes of herself with her phone. Unlike her namesake, this child can communicate, but is so engrossed by her phone that she is usually not paying attention, just repeating the last word said.

In battle, her self absorption results in a skill which collects all the buffs from friend and foe and stacks them on herself, effected by her holding up her camera and taking a selfie.
