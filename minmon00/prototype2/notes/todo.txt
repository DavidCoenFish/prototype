X	dag node collection able to draw triangle
X	dag node collection able to draw render target texture on quad
X	draw canvas text and use texture in webgl
	draw pbr spheres
	X	can i make mip map of float texture
	X	can i sample mip map of float texture
		make a material editor (sphere and param)
			pbr param of gloss and ref amount.
	water drop
	eyeball
	dag manager
	

i have a design problem, the concept with the dag was to have the inputs collected, will all the
items calling getValue, and then passing the input values to the calculate.
this was to have a controlled order of operations so that the input was fully calculated before doing the next calculate
(allow render to target to finish draw before using the output texture....)

as such, the shader data items need to take a value, not a dag node, and possibly be kept in a array to match the inputs of the
dag node.


glyph
	TextManager
		given text string, font size and font name, and ref to glyphManager
	GlyphManager
		given a html5 canvas to draw glyphs to, and return a reference to a html5 canvas to use as texture, and the data about each glyph
		addGlyph(in_glyph, in_fontName, in_fontSize)
		removeGlyphs(in_glyph, in_fontName, in_fontSize)
	GlyphData
	render

hdr background
	can i get away with hdr env maps of blur radius
1x1
4x4
16x16
64x64
	for about a 128x256 hdr, also need to calculate a weight table (or functions) to go from scater param to weight of each blur map
