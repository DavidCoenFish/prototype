X	dag node collection able to draw triangle
X	dag node collection able to draw render target texture on quad
	draw canvas text and use texture in webgl
	draw pbr spheres
	water drop
	eyeball
	dag manager
	

i have a design problem, the concept with the dag was to have the inputs collected, will all the
items calling getValue, and then passing the input values to the calculate.
this was to have a controlled order of operations so that the input was fully calculated before doing the next calculate
(allow render to target to finish draw before using the output texture....)

as such, the shader data items need to take a value, not a dag node, and possibly be kept in a array to match the inputs of the
dag node.


glyph
	TextManager
		given text string, font size and font name, and ref to glyphManager
	GlyphManager
		given a html5 canvas to draw glyphs to, and return a reference to a html5 canvas to use as texture, and the data about each glyph
		addGlyph(in_glyph, in_fontName, in_fontSize)
		removeGlyphs(in_glyph, in_fontName, in_fontSize)
		
	GlyphData


	render
